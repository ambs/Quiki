YET ANOTHER WIKI?
-----------------
Yes!

There are already a lot of Wikis in Perl:

    * Kwiki — not really maintained, not stable
    * twiki — big, heavy, complicated
    * mojomojo — catalyst based. More than 200 Perl modules of dependencies
    * socialtext — commercial

We fell the Perl community is lacking a simple yet powerful
wiki. Something like DokuWiki. If you ask why not to use DokuWiki, we
would love to, but having Perl projects hosted in a PHP Wiki is not
positive.
